Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Happy, that's you, you made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I, till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)
Where have I been, what lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until, Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was till now
Till now
Happy, yeah, yeah, happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah happy, ooh, happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy, oh yeah happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy

And I can hear that doggone thing

Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired, I cant lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again

I got to walk on
Let me tell yall Im so tired now
But I just cant lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you now Im so tired
But I just cant lose my stride
I got to walk on

As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do so I stopped and got out
And looked down and noticed I got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist
I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there
Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No Name
As she took me right through the fog
I see a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and smiling and
No one's in fear
She said this is the place where no people have pain
And in love and happiness
She turned around looked down at my eyes and started cryin'
She grabbed my hand, you got a friend
Woah-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
Yeah Yeah
She started likin' me kissin' me and huggin' me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen things I've never done
This place really looks like a lotta fun
I seen the grass and the sky and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
and not a world could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought you could be in another world
Ooh-ooh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
No name
Take me to a place without no name
No Name
Take me to a place without no name

But like a two edged sword, It cuts you and it stabs me
All along, I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask and you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth, but that's your hiding place
You say you love me, but it's hard to see
'cause when he's in your arms you're throwing rocks at me
Who do you love?
Is it me, with you?
I don't know

But that's the way you cry girl

All is grand, all is bright
(You're just studying my mind)
I walk around, I'm suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask, so I can se your face
Who do you love?
Is it me, with you?
I don't know
Who do you love?
I don't want ya
if you can't answer
I know you
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You got me spinnin', girl
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, yours are good
(Where's your soul? Where'd it go?)
You got me scared, girl
(Heaven must be wary)
Heaven must be wary
(Your smile is scary)
You know where you've been
(Insincere, empty tears)
Every year, na na na
(Where's your soul? Where did it go?)
I walk around suffering in my doom
When I come to you, you're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask so I can see your face
Who do you love?

I don't wanna talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
I don't wanna talk about it
(Let's talk about it)
Told me that you're doin' wrong
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it

Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
But too bad, too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the place
I'm right back where I wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it

Reality brings forth realizm

Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it

Ben, you're always running here and there

I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"

Now it's "us", now it's "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
(A friend)
Like Ben

I am your joy, your best of joy,
I am the moonlight, you are the spring,
our life's a sacred thing,
You know I always will love you, I am forever.
I am the one who came when you fell down,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
I am forever.
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seems so hard to be, and things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever
I am your friend,
Through thick and thin,
We need each other,
We'll never part,
Our love is from the heart,
We never say "I don't need you",
We are forever.
I am the one who said that you are free,
When living seems so hard to be (the only one),
And nothing would cheer you,
I am forever,
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumbling down,
When things would hurt you,
I am forever, I am forever,
We are forever, we are forever.
You are the sun that lights up the sky,
When things are shady,
Let come what may we do get by,
I was the only one around (the only one),
When things would hurt you,
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (I am forever),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
We are forever (gotta do and do more, have to be strong),
We are forever (gotta do and do more),
we are forever, (uh- hum, all right),
I am forever,
I am forever,
I am forever (uh- hum, all right),
we are forever,
we are forever (hee),
I am forever,
I am forever.

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed
Of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me "be careful of what you do"
"And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me "be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told "my baby, that's a threat"
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying
Eyes were like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
No, she is not just my baby
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
You know what you did
She says he is my son
Breaking my heart, babe
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Call me, Billie Jean
Billie Jean is not my lover
She is not at the scene
Billie jean is not my lover
She was more like a beauty queen
from a movie scene
I said dont mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance
on the floor

She said I am the one

Her schemes and plans
Go dance on
on the floor
in the round
So take my strong advice
just remember to always think twice
(do think twice)
She told my baby
we'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
his eyes were like mine (oh, no!)
Go dance
on the floor
in the round
People always told me
be careful of what you do
And dont go around
breaking young girls hearts

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
An it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you
Yes we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles and a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter, if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them, I ain't second to none
And I told about equality and it's true
Either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Sew when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean
Protection for gangs clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See it's not about races just places faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me when I saw you
Kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said, if you're thinkin' of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said, if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Ooh, ooh, yea, yea, yea, now
Ooh, ooh, yea, yea, yea, now
It's black it's white
It's tough for them to get by
It's black it's white,
It's black it's white
It's tough for them to get by
It's black it's white, whoo
My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kind a disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
That nasty boogie bugs me
but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't (Yeah)
I just can't (Woo) control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
Sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
This magic music grooves me
that dirty rhythm fools me
The devil's gotten to me through this dance
I'm full of funky fever
a fire burns inside me
Boogie's got me in a super trance
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Ow (Sunshine)
Ooh (Moonlight)
Yeah (Good times)
Mmm (Boogie)
You just gotta (Sunshine)
Yeah (Moonlight)
(Good times)
Good times (Boogie)
Don't you blame it (Sunshine)
You just gotta (Moonlight)
You just wanna (Good times)
Yeah, oh (Boogie)
Blame it on yourself (Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (Good times)
All night long (Boogie)
Can't stop that boogie (Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie (Good times)
Dancin' all night long (Boogie)
Blame it on yourself (Sunshine)
Ain't nobody's fault (Moonlight)
But yours and that boogie, boogie, boogie (Good times)
All night long (Boogie)
Alone tonight
Me here tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine
She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?
Susie got your number, and Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right
Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-Take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)
I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain't your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around
It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it
You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby
She got your number
She know your game
She put you under
It's so insane
Since you seduced her
How does it feel
To know that woman
Is out to kill
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Right on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right
She got your number
How does it feel
To know the stranger
Is out to kill
She got your baby
It happened fast
If you could only erase the past
Every night stance is like takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you're gonna get it
Every hot man is out takin' a chance
It's not about love and romance
And now you do regret it
To escape the world
I got to enjoy that simple dance
And it seemed that everything was on my side
(Right on my side)
She seemed sincere like it was love
And true romance
And now she's out to get me
But I just can't take it
Just can't break it
Susie got your number
And Susie ain't your friend
Look who took you under
With seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
Susie got your number
And Susie says it's right
Susie got your number
Susie ain't your friend
(It's going down, baby)
Look who took you under
She stuck seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor
Blood is on the knife
(It's going down, baby)
Susie got your number
You know Susie says it's right
It was blood on the dance floor
(Blood on the dance floor)
And I just can't take it
The girl won't break it

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain and heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you?
Darling the days
I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me
Dreams of golden glare taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me
...
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna to kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want then I want it too
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewheree
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me
Call on me
Yes, happiness
Waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me

Lose it? Lose it?
I don't even know the first thing about what they're feeling;
What am I afraid of?
Don't know what I'm made of,
Can I go on, not knowing?
Feeling? Feeling?
Something tells me that it's more than I can deal with;
Tho I never knew the song,
Some words still catch on like caring,
And sharing being together, no matter,
Can I go on not knowing?
Don't know what I'm made of,
why am I afraid of
Feel-ing? Feel-ing? If I dare to take a chance,
Would someone lead me?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
If you look around
The whole world is comin' together now, baby
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feel it in the air
The wind is taking it everywhere, yeah
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother
When hate won't do, ooh
'Cause we're all the same, yes
The blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah, yeah, oh
Every breath you take
Is someone's death in another place
(Another place, another place, another place)
Every healthy smile
Is hunger and strife to another child
(Another child, another child)
But the stars do shine
In promising salvation, is near this time
(Near this time)
Can you feel it now?
So brothers and sisters show me know how
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Yeah yeah oh
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
All the children in the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Take the news to the marching men
Who are killing their brothers
When death won't do, ooh
Yes, we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I breakdown when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie
(Is it just a lie)
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shape
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this thing come true
(Make this dream come true)
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I can't let

I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I tried to mastermind it
By saying let it be
But evertime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye
(Still you said goodbye)
If I let her get away
Then the world will have to see
A fool who lives alone
And the fool who sets you free
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away(no)
I can't let
I Can't Let Her Get Away

Baby, baby
You put my heart in your face
And then you claim its some game
And then you tell all these lies
Cause you don't have alibi
(I'm gettin' a little sick of it baby)
(I'm getting frustrated)
Cause I can't get your weight off of me (uh-oh)
Cause I can't push you away from me
Even though your skinny and small
It's your love that's too tall
And now it's too much, baby!
You wave my love in my face
Even though it's too great
The power in you cannot hold it all
(And know she thinks I'm cheatin')
(And now I'm hardly breathin')
Cause I can't get your weight off of me (uh-oh)
Cause I can't push you away from me
Even though your skinny and small
It's your love that's too tall
And now it's too much, baby!
Cause I can't get your weight off of me (uh-oh)
Cause I can't push you away from me
Even though your skinny and small
It's your love that's too tall
And now it's too much, baby!
Too much baby
Too much kissing
Too much love for me
Cause I'm drowning in sorrow now
I said I had enough of your love
I want to take back
Cause I miss you baby! (miss you)
(Baby!)
Cause I can't get your weight off of me (uh-oh)
Cause I can't push you away from me
Even though your skinny and small
It's your love that's too tall
And now it's too much, baby!
Cause I can't get your weight off of me (uh-oh)
Cause I can't push you away from me
Even though your skinny and small
It's your love that's too tall
And now it's too much, baby!
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away.
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear her crying here
And I can hear her calling me.
I lost my heart
On the carousel (lost my girl)
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Lost my heart
On The carousel
To a circus girl
Never have I ever been so sure
(Oh no, now)
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door
(Oh no, yeah)
I can make you feel
(Like you're a queen)
No remedies
(No compromise)
Would you rather be, right here with me
I want you right here next to me
[Chorus:]
Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you wanna walk away
(If you let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
(Change your mind)
Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you really wanna go?
(If you let it go)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
She never thought she'd be here waiting on me
(Oh no, now)
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my days
(We can take it slow)
Ohhhh
When you're in need
Your fantasy
(All here with me)
Would you rather be, right here with me
Girl get into me
[Chorus]
Anything, oh anything
To chase the rain goodbye
When you left with all your dreams
I couldn't say goodnight
She was contagious, she was contagious
She was my baby
Te quiero
(Te quiero mi amor)
I love you
Say goodbye
(Say goodbye)
Say goodbye
[Chorus]
I'll never let you go
(Do you really walk away?)
I'll never let you go
Never let you go
(I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind)
Never let you go
(Do you really wanna stay?)
Uhhhh
(Do you really wanna go?)
(So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye)
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
(Change your mind)
Uhhhh
Don't go away
Stay by my side
Stay by my side

VocÃª jÃ¡ tentou me amarrar
Mas o nosso amor era fogueira
Eu queria sÃ³ brincar de amar
VocÃª nÃ£o queria brincadeira
Que vontade louca
JÃ¡ virou um vicio
Beijar sua boca, mas sem compromisso
Eu to te querendo
SÃ³ um pouco mais
Pra ver se esse amor Ã© o que me satisfaz
Por que vocÃª nÃ£o para pra pensar
NÃ£o vÃª que eu to querendo seu amor
Mas nÃ£o vou entrar nessa de sonhar
Pra nÃ£o permanecer ao seu dispor
Melhor deixarmos tudo como estÃ¡
O nosso amor foi sÃ³ uma tara e mais nada
Melhor Ã© deixar pra lÃ¡.

Miscellaneous
Childhood
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me...
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the ChildhoodI've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates and adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
For the Childhood I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my Childhood...
Written and Composed by Michael Jackson.
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart...
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities...
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me...
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things...
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood
I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams,
Of conquest and kings on the throne...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me,
Look within your heart then ask,
Have you seen my Childhood?
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things,
It's been my fate to compensate,
for the Childhood I've never known...
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly...
Before you judge me, try hard to love me.
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my Childhood...
Cinderella, stay awhile
You're the one
That I've been lookin' for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall
Midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile
Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna to fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess
I am sure of it
This is love for sure
Love that's sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile
When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh
Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairytales are coming true
Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please don't disappear
Stay awhile, oh
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)
(Fairytales, make-believe and you)
Cinderella, stay awhile
Don't you go
Oh
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Two different people in love for an instant
They say that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me
(I lost my heart)
Lost my heart
(On the carousel)
Lost my girl
(To a circus girl)
Who ran away
I lost
(Lost my heart)
I lost my girl
(On the carousel)
(To a circus girl)

I'm reaching for you, and you're not even near
Still feeling your touch in the air
The thought of your kiss still lingers in my mind
Can't forget about the days when you were mine
Pre-chorus:
Now I'm lying in the dark [lying in the dark]
Slowly dying from my broken heart
Chorus:
[My condition's getting worse]
[I see you and] man it hurts
[I need you here back in my life]
[It's critical, critical]
[Got me sick without your touch] without your touch
[I never thought it hurt this] much
[I need you here right by my side]
[It's critical, critical]
Been a week since you left, but time is standing still
I'm so weak from the fall, I lost the will
Put my pride on the shell, and beg for one more chance
Please tell me you'll try to understand
Pre-chorus:
Now I'm lying in the dark [lying in the dark]
Slowly dying from my broken heart
Chorus:
[My condition's getting worse]
[I see you and] man it hurts

I never thought it hurt this much
[I need you here right] by my side
[It's critical, critical]
Hook:
It's critical, I need your touch [put your hand upon my heart and I will heal it up]
Come and bring me back to life [back to life]
Get me back on my feet, and help me learn how to breathe again
With you I know I can, I know I can
Chorus:
[My condition's getting worse] my condition
[I see you and] I see you and man it hurts
[I need you here back in my life] my life

No-whoa... yeah... *sigh*
Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend (Hold on)
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue when it's all gonna end again
Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth (Hold on)
When will this mystery unfold
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind mans eyes when he cries
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If people laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is taking a life (Hold on)
Respect to believe in your dreams
So tell me where were you
When your children cried last night
Faces filled with madness
Miracles unheard of (Hold on)
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do is to reach for the truth, the truth
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
And when that flag glows there'll be no more wars
And when all cause I will answer all your prayers (Prayers)
Show the world...
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world (I can't do it by myself)
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
You can change the world
You can touch the sky (It's gonna take somebody's help)
You're the chosen one (I'm gonna need some kind of sign)
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
If we all cry at the same time tonight
Change the world

The Way She Came Into The Place
I Knew Right Then And There
There Was Something Different
About This Girl
The Way She Moved
Her Hair, Her Face, Her Lines
Divinity In Motion
As She Stalked The Room
I Could Feel The Aura
Of Her Presence
Every Head Turned
Feeling Passion And Lust
The Girl Was Persuasive
The Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew But I Was
Walking The Line
Come Go With Me
I Said I Have No Time
And Don't You Pretend We Didn't
Talk On The Phone
My Baby Cried
She Left Me Standing Alone
She's So Dangerous
The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money
Throw Away My Time
You Can Call Me Honey
But You're No Damn Good For Me
She Came At Me In Sections
With The Eyes Of Desire
I Fell Trapped Into Her
Web Of Sin
A Touch, A Kiss
A Whisper Of Love
I Was At The Point
Of No Return
Deep In The Darkness Of
Passion's Insanity
I Felt Taken By Lust's
Strange Inhumanity
This Girl Was Persuasive
This Girl I Could Not Trust
The Girl Was Bad
The Girl Was Dangerous
I Never Knew
But I Was Living In Vain
She Called My House
She Said You Know My Name

The Girl Is So Dangerous
Take Away My Money

It's A Passion In My Soul
But You're No Damn Lover
Friend Of Mine
I Can not Sleep Alone Tonight
My Baby Left Me Here Tonight
I Cannot Cope 'Til It's All Right
You And Your Manipulation
You Hurt My Baby
And Then It Happened
She Touched Me
For The Lips Of
A Strange Woman
Drop As A Honeycomb
And Her Mouth Was
Smoother Than Oil
But Her Inner Spirit And Words
Were As Sharp As
A Two-Edged Sword
But I Loved It

You'll probably never get this letter
Michael, I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel
I'll write a hundred more"
"Dear Michael, every time your record's on
Michael, I close my eyes and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me."
And then she wrote:
"Michael, I love you
I held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"
I'm gonna answer your letter
(Michael Michael)
I'll start beginning with the ABC's of loving you
(I love ya)

So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok
Hey baby do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin me so to start
She says there's no turnin back
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be!
Oh no
Oh no

She likes the boys in the bands
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after
The curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise
Fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying that's ok
Hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say

He's taking her on the streets, of Sunset Boulevard
She's selling her body hard, girl that will take you far
The police come 'round the corner, somebody there they told
He's arresting this little girl, that's only twelve years old!

Don't Walk Away
See I just can't find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you'll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray
How can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there's nothing left to do but walk away
(yeah)
I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it's been so long now all I do is cry
Can't we find some love to take this away
'Cause the pain gets stronger every day
How can I begin again
Now how am I to understand
When there's nothing left to do but walk away
(yeaah)

Even though I had to let you go

Even though I had to let you go There's nothing left to do Don't Walk Away

Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe
Capture me, my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you, my skin is shed
Ecstasy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say that's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive, eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive
Now I got you on the run
The quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times with a little stimulation
It'll come once more
And you say that's impossible
It's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive, eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're dangerous
No more hearts I can trust
You see, I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Gotta do her, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive
Welcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do what you were told
But they robbed you of childhood
Took your youth and sold it for gold
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me
Lovely Elizabeth

Full of life and carrying on

You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star...
This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But though all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were beating life's battles
Again and again
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth can't you see that it's true
Remember the time I was alone
You stood by my side and said:
"Let's be strong"
You did all these tings
That only a true friend can do
Elizabeth, I love you
The world knows your work now
Of all the things on earth now
I pray one day I'll be just like... you.

Euphoria
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It's very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers
Euphoria
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
SOMETHING ABOUT YOU, starin' in your eyes
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
We fought in a battle, nobody won
NOW WE FACE A MOUNTAIN TO BE OVERCOME
You can't run away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
You'll try everything
You never thought WOULD WORK before
When you live, when you love, and you give them your all
You can always give up some more
BABY nothing means anything
Unless you're here TO SHARE with me
I can breathe, I can bleed, I can die in my sleep
Cause you're always there in my dreams
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in may
I bumped into you by the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye, bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh, yeah
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down?
Or someone that you don't forget, no?
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year
When you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye, bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Ooh, farewell, farewell
Ooh, farewell, farewell
If you remember my name
(Drop a line)
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl oh yeah
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, farewell yeah, yeah, yeah
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch, you know so well
Somebody once said, it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well
And maybe the walls will tumble
And sun may refuse to shine
But when I say 'I love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'll go anywhere, just as long as you are there
And maybe the walls will tumble
And sun refuse to shine
When I say 'I love you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Ohh... then on these quiet days
Where souls embrace
So silently
Ohh... the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say
And maybe the walls will crumble
And sun refuse to shine
But when I say 'I need you'
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Say that you'll never go
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
Baby, you gotta know
That's for all time
(That's for all time) Don't lie, Don't lie
(That's for all time) Baby, make loving
Say that you'll never go
Baby, you gotta know
I said maybe tonight
We will get it right
We will get around (tonight)
So get around me (I love you today)
Get around them (You save the day)
Get around the world today
And show me what you got
Cause you ain't gonna give up
Ah, on the floor and dance
Ah, on the floor and dance
So get on the floor

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's haunting me
I don't understand it
Hey
I don't understand it!
...Aaow
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no-one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it!
Hey
Don't understand it!
...Ha-Hey!
And who gave you the right to shame my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shame my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
There's a thumpin' in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where a restless soul is going
Don't understand it!
Yeah Yeah!
Don't understand it!
You're just a dog gone!
Aaow!
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to scare my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shame my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take intrusion, to see me?
And who gave you the right to shame my family?
And who gave you the right to hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shame my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
A suckin' ghost of jealousy
...Aaow!
And who gave you the right to shame my family?
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shame my family tree?
And who gave you the right to take, intrusion to see me?
And who gave you the right to hurt my family?
And who gave you the right hurt my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shame my family tree?
You put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me!
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy
Aaow!
Dog gone
But there's no doubt about it, piece of mind
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
Girl you're so together
Together we can make it, all the way
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe, yeah
It's no dreams
But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries
Just won't do, ooh baby
Even the flowers and lollipops
Could never hope to top
The sweetness of your kiss
Can you dig it?
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it, all the way, yeah, yeah
If I had a chance to choose
Between a million bucks and you
I'd choose you babe
(Choose you babe)
Girl your smile, ooh
Is like the month of may, yeah
When you're near me
The storm clouds stay away, yeah
Even the little honey bees
Turn to you when they need more honey
Love you so much it's not funny
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way, yeah
Oh, girl, you're so together
Oh, hey girl, girl, eye, eye, popper
A real life traffic stopper
A knock-out queen
Oh, what I mean is
Girl you're so together
And together we can make it all the way
Oh, I love her, I love her, I love, I love you babe
(Girl you're so together)
Yeah
(And together we can make it all the way)
Ooh, girl, you're so together
(Repeat and fade out)
Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see
The forest for the trees
You've been so true
I've been so cruel to you
Oh, girl please don't leave me
Chorus:
If you stay I'll find a way
To erase the past
Baby don't leave me
Girl don't take your love from me
Oh girl
What can I say to make you stay
Baby, don't leave me
You've been so kind
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you
Chorus:
Tell me girl, it's not to late
And you give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Girl don't take your love
Don't take your love
Bridge:
Girl, if you take your love away from me
I'm gonna be in misery
Your love is the strength that I lean upon
How will I make it when it's gone
Of all the little things I wanted to say...
...I really wanted to do
Girl, this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it
Chorus:
So tell me girl, it's not too late
And you'll give me a chance
To make it up to you
Don't take your love from me
Don't take your love, no no no no no
Don't take your love
Don't leave me girl
Don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
Don't take your love from me
Oooh, don't take your love from me
Baby, don't take your love from me
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
You've always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay
And it's okay
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay
And I, I gotta find
Gotta, the peace of mind, no
Don't try to tell me
Because your words
Just aren't enough
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin' me higher
Talk to me woman

Sadness had been close as my next of kin

My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while

Let Happy be where Sadness was

Suspended between time and space
Lonely until, Happy came smiling up at me

Sweet thing, let me tell you 'bout
The world and the way things are
You've come from a different place
And I know you're traveled far
Now that you told me what it is
I'd better point you towards the Wiz
He's the Wiz, he's the man, he's the only one
Who can give your wish right to ya
He's the Wizard, he'll send you back through time
By runnin' magic through ya
All of the super power's his
Listen and I'll tell you where he is
He's the Wiz and he lives in Oz
He's the Wizard, there's the way to the Emerald City
Now that's not too far, is it?
He's the Wizard, just take you dilemma child
And lay it on the Wizard
He'll fix you a drink that's
Bubble and foam
And in a flash you will be home
He's the Wiz, he's the Wizard of Oz
He's got magic up his sleeve
He's the Wizard and you know without his help
'T would be impossible to leave
Fantastic powers at his command
And I'm sure that he will understand
He's the Wiz and he lives in Oz
He's the Wizard, he's the Wizard
He's the Wizard
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much
Brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel
There's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
Make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in
Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life
Wound this earth crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords
Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
she only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
only for me, then spoke with her body
her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no

That girl I can't take her

I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
ans she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same
That girl I can't take her
should have known she was a heartbreaker(all the lie thing)
that girl I can't take her(that girl)

that girl I can't take her(hoo)
see right through her she's a heartbreaker(doggon, hoo)
I never thought that I would stop dreamin' about you, Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you, and start being without you
but I'll find a way to go and start doin' without you, and stop talkin' aboout you
and what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away

Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't want to go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no
Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no
Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Oh no, can't be without my baby
Won't go, without her I'd go crazy
Oh no, guess Heaven will be waiting
Ooh
Tell the angels no, I don't want to leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
Just leave us alone, leave us alone
Please leave us alone
I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...
If everyday was Christmas
If we could make believe
If everyone would care a little more
There'd be harmoney
The city is covered in snow tonight
The children fast asleep
I'm waiting for him, but he's nowhere in sight
And I wonder if he can hear me
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
Bring my baby home tonight
Why does it feel like it's colder than winter
Even by the fireside
My baby said he'd be home for Christmas
And now it's almost midnight
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing till he's with me
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry
Bring my baby tonight
I know your sleigh is full inside
But won't you stop and give my baby a ride
I'll be waiting by candle light this Christmas
The Christmas lights up and down the street
Are such a sight to see
But all the presents by the tree
They don't mean a thing
Santa please hear me
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I wish with all my might
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
If you hear me won't you hurry
Bring my baby tonight
The Christmas lights up and down the street
The presents by the tree
I hear a knock, oh can it be?
My wish is staring back at me
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I guess you heard me tonight
Hey Santa
Hey Santa...Santa
I'm underneath the mistletoe
With my baby tonight
Sleigh ride...
It's Christmas time...
Hey Santa, can you bring me something good
(Something good, something good)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something sweet
(Something sweet, something, something sweet)?
Like chocolate kisses or candy canes.
Gumdrops or butterscotch, fruity flavor, chewy rings.
Hey Santa, can you bring me something nice
(Something nice, something nice)?
Hey Santa, can you bring me something new
(Something new, something, something new)?
Like a diamond bracelet or a diamond ring.
How about a shiny new, baby blue, convertible?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Hey Santa, can I sing this song to you
(Sing to you, sing to you)?
Hey Santa, can you make my wish come true
(Make it true, make it, make it true)?
Can you fill my stocking with lots of treats?
Boxes with red and green, underneath the Christmas tree?
Hey Santa, can you bring me everything?
He got kicked in the back
He say that he needed that
He hot willed in the face
Keep daring to motivate
He say one day you will see
His place in world history
He dares to be recognized
The fires deep in his eyes
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Don't let no one get you down
Keep movin' on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand
Everybody sing...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And leave one family oh...
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
A soldier dies

Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
(That way) Why why
(That way) Why why
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say,
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say,
Why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, cha cha cha cha cha cha
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, why, why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, ooo tell 'em
Why does he do me that way
If they say why, da da da da da da da da
Why does he do my that way, I like living this way
Why, oh why, why, why
1st verse
Looking out
Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
2nd verse
Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls wont hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
Chorus
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
3rd verse
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are evrywhere
See that girl
She knows Im watching
She likes the way I stare
Chorus
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
I like livin this way
I like lovin this way
4th verse
Looking out
Across the morning
The citys heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
Im dreaming of the street
Chorus
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say -
Why, why, tell em that is human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
I like livin this way
(repeat chorus - ad-lib/fade-out)
I can't believe that is real
The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh, it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah
"I can touch the stars
I can touch the sun
feel the wind in my face
feel the power of the Great.
I can do everything
as true as I exist
I can, I can
because you're here with me."
refrain: That's what I thought
when I was a child
because You were there by my side
That's what I thought
when I was a child
I didn't know the evil
likes to drink even your blood
"I can fly as angels
I am one of them
give me one white arch
and I'll show to them
and we'll show to them"
refrain: That's what I thought
when I was a child
because You were there by my side
That's what I thought
when I was a child
I didn't know the evil
likes to drink even your blood
Can I touch the stars
can He lift me up
will you hold my hand
than you can go back
that's all I'm asking now
just some minutes to say
just some minutes to say
just some minutes to say:
That's what I thought
when I was a child
I didn't know the evil
likes to drink even your blood
and the never have enough
and they never have enough
God will they ever have enough?
I Can't Help It
Looking In My Mirror
Took Me By Surprise
I Can't Help But See You
Running Often Through My Mind
Helpless Like A Baby
Sensual Disguise
I Can't Help But Love You
It's Getting Better All The Time
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
Love To Run My Fingers
Softly While You Sigh
Love Came And Possessed You
Bringing Sparkles To Your Eyes
Like A Trip To Heaven
Heaven Is The Prize
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl
You're An Angel In Disguise
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
And I'm So Glad I Found You Girl
You're An Angel In Disguise
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It Even If I Could
I Can't Help It If I Wanted To
I Wouldn't Help It, No
verse 1
some people say
I live in a fantasy
because I see the world
differently
visions come to me
in my sleep
I closed my eyes
to see what God is showing me
close your eyes
and imagine with me
see the wonder
in every living thing
if we can live our lives
the way it is in my dreams
love will take us to a place where
god can be seen
this is my dream
I have this dream
this i believe
the world a place for all humanity
if we could take love to it's highest level
more than the world has ever seen
I have this dream
verse 2
let's put Gods love opn display
angel of love come my way
it really up to you and me
one world together in harmony
in my dream I see heaven
and the face of the one perfect being
I see people turning into angels
and God giving them their wings
this is my dream
chorus
I have this dream
this I believe
the world's a place
for all humanity
if we could take love
to it's highest level
more than the world has ever seen
I have this dream
repeat chorus

You're givin' me true love
And everyday I thank the Lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
A tender melody pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world made for you and me
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony, baby
Whenever your near, I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby
Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now, baby
Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love
Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love
Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now
Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say i love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life
Without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if i stop
Then tell me just what
Will I do
'cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the
Stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how i feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my life ain't
Worth living
If i can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey
Farewell To sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
No, baby
Oh!
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop!
And if I stop
Oh! Oh! Oh, Oh
What will I do? Uh . . .Ooh . . .
(then tell me, just what will I do)
I just can't stop loving you
I do Girl!
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
And if I stop
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you...
I just want to lay next to you for awhile
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth Is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name . . .
Whispers at morning
Our love Is dawning
Heaven's glad you came . . .
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you...
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time Is forever
Love Is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring...
Heaven's In my heart
At your all I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do...
I just can't stop loving you...
At night when the stars shine
Hmm

A love so true . . .
Mmm... mmm...
When morning wakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you...
You know how I feel

Oh wherever I go

I'm in love again
This time I think that it's for real
I'm in love again
I think I know just how you feel
It's like waking early on christmas morning
And finding the toy of your dream
And that's the way you make me feel, girl
And that's the way that it should be
I'm in love again
This time I think that it's for sure
I'm in love again
It's what I've lived my whole life for
You've given me such happiness
You've given me so much joy
You've changed my sadness into gladness
How could I ask for more...
I'm in love, I'm in love again

Looking over my photographs

Lovin' me deep

And to find out if you really love missin' me 'cos
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
If you don't need me
Just like I need you

And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me

(What will I do baby?)
'Cos I'm in love with you

And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl?
Tell me what I wanna hear
Like your missin' me 'cos
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If you don't need me

'Cos I'm in love with you
You!
Oh, baby, baby, I've been missing you
For such a long, long time ago
You changed your number and I couldn't call you
So I couldn't tell you so
I had to write you just to tell you that
I may be kissing on your photograph
If you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
And if you don't love me
(If you don't love me)
Baby baby, baby

And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
Aow!
If you don't love me
If you don't love me
If n' I was God, well, just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see
If' n' I was God, I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks who would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me
Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me
If n' I was God, I'd make us wise
So everyone could realize
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone
And God that in heaven I would do
If n' I were You
If n' I was God, I'd make us wise
Everybody touch everybody's hand
Reach out and touch somebody's hand
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
You got to, you got to, you got to love everybody
You got to love everybody
You got to, you got to love everybody
Come everybody, come on, come on

Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share
Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
In despair we'll be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough
Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need
Refrain
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today...
In our small way
You're just preaching the Bible and they still speakin you're a lier
And you still deal with the fires
That they made...

We could be together
Why you wanna hit me
We could be together
Why you wanna get me
See, If the police don't take it

Why you stab me in the back?
There's Something I Have To Say To You

When In Your Presence
I'm So Humble
Touch Me
Don't Hide Our Love

HIStory Tour Intro/Medley
Song in order of appearence: Scream, They Don't Care About Us, & Scream.
----------------------------------
Scream:
Tired of injustice
'M tired of these schemes
These lives are disgustin'
So what does it mean? Dabbi
Kickin' me down,
I got ta git up.
As jacked as it sounds,
The whole system sucks. Dabbi
With such confusion don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimise within the scheme.
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize.
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
I'm tired of ya tellin',
The story your way.
It causes confusion.
You think it's ok. Dabbi
You're changin' the rules,
You're playin' their game.
Can't take it much longer,
I think I might go insane!
Now baby!
With such delusions don't it make you wanna scream?
Your bash abusin' victimise within the scheme.
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize.
Oh father please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Jus' stop pressurin' on me.
Stop pressurin' on me.
Make me wanna scream.
-------------------------
They don't care about us:
Skinhead, deadhead.
Everybody gone bad.
Situation, aggravation.
Everybody allegation.
In the suite, on the news
Everybody dog food
Bang bang, shot dead
Everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
Tell me what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me.
I'm a victim of police brutality, no.
I'm tired of bein' the victim of hate.
Your rapin' me of my pride
and for G**'s sake
I look to heaven to fulfill this prophecy.
Set me free!
Skinhead, deadhead.
Everybody gone bad.
Trepidation speculation.
Everybody allegation.
In the suite, on the news.
Everybody dog food.
Black man, black mail
Throw the brother in jail
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
Hoooooo!
Everyday, create your history.
Some things in life they just don't wanna see.
But if Martin Luther was livin',
he wouldn't let this be! No no!
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about . . .
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about . . .
All I wanna say is that,
They don't really care about us
---------------------------------
In The Closet:
Keep it in the closet.
She just a lover,
Who's doin' me by.
It worth the givin'
It's worth the try.
You cannot cleave it,
Put it in the furnace.
You cannot wet it.
You cannot burn it.
(Spoken) One thing in life you must understand,
The truth of lust, woman to man.
So open the door and you will see.
There are no secrets make your move set me free.
Ah, because somethin' about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there somethin' about you baby, oh.
(Spoken) Just promise me
Whatever we say or do to each other
For now we make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
Never give in.
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But girl you
Just won't approve of the things that I do When all I do is for you but
Still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do Giving you
Everything, fulfilling your fantasy Then maybe you'll change your mind and
Finally give in in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you my baby
Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible
There's a ghost out in the hall
Theirs a goul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh
Is it scary for you baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you baby
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
Their's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coughin' and a yawnin'
Where restless soul's spoke
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The foolish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the light
But if you came to see
The truth the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart
So let the performance start
[Mix]
Someone is watching me
The king has rissen
The king has rissen
[...]
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn't. It's the beginning
[Thriller]
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight, you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about strike
You know it's thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'alls neighborhood
And whoever shall be found without the soul for getting down must stand and
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a
Killer, diller, chiller, thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more than any ghost would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, ow!
Hahahahaha
There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's haunting me
Because you're wanting me
To be the stranger
In the night
Am I amusing you
But just confusing me?
Am I the beast
You visualized?
And if you wanna see
Eccentric oddities
I'll be grotesque
Before your eye
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
Is it scary for you big baby
Is it scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you big baby
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is pokin'
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before
Your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing
In the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside
A lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you baby

Can hardly reveal the proof
Like a mirror reveals the truth

Am I scary for you oh boy
Am I scary for you baby
Am I scary for you oh boy
So tell me

Wanna talk about
Am I scary for you baby
Is that scary for you
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you baby, oh
Miles away, oceans apart
Never in my sight, but always in my heart
The love is always there, it will never die
Only growing stronger, a tear rolls down my eye
I'm thinking all the time
When the day will come
Standing there before you
Accept this Hajj of mine
Standing in ihram, making my tawaf
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
I feel alive and I feel strong
I can feel Islam running through my veins
To see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same
Greeting one another, exalting one True Name
I truly hope one day that everyone's a muslim
that they remember you in everything they says
Standing in ihram making my tawaf
Drinking blessings from Your well
The challenge of Safa and Marwa
Rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
Praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
It's the fallin' in love
that's making me high
it's the being in love that make me cry, cry, cry
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I find myself attracted to you
This time I'm trying not to go too far, cause...
Bridge
No matter how it starts it ends the same
Someone's always doing someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again
Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night... all night
(Patti Austin)
And though I'm trying not to look in your eyes
Each time I do they kind of burn right through me
Don't want to lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is saying come and do me
Bridge
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the fantasy of what might be
But here I go falling again
Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
Over you... over you (all night)
Chorus
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry cry cry
All night... all night
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
(Holding on, holding on, holding on)
Yes I will, yes I will
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
I'll be there to protect you
(Yeah baby)
With an unselfish love I respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
(I'll be there)
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
(I'll be there)
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
(Holding on, holding on, holding on)
Yes I will, yes I will
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there
(I'll be there)
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there

Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl

Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave yoou
When my restless heart says goodbye
Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I'd change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I'm home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I gotta need one girl
Never can feel
Refrain
Yeah I'm Johnny Raven by and by
Oh, I'm going to leave yoour nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I shouldn't have loved you
Yeah, but I gotta leave yoou
When my restless heart says goodbye
Everybody knows my name
I'm Johnny Raven yeah, yeah by abd by
I'm gonna fly
When you cry part of me's gonna die
Joy to the World , the Lord is come!
Let earth receive her King;
Let every heart prepare Him room,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven and nature sing,
And Heaven, and Heaven, and nature sing.
Joy to the World, the Savior reigns!
Let men their songs employ;
While fields and floods, rocks, hills and plains
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat the sounding joy,
Repeat, repeat, the sounding joy.
No more let sins and sorrows grow,
Nor thorns infest the ground;
He comes to make His blessings flow
Far as the curse is found,
Far as the curse is found,
Far as, far as, the curse is found.
He rules the world with truth and grace,
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders of His love,
And wonders, wonders, of His love.
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away

Ever do what you do for me
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love

Has become my daily need
Just a little o' your love, every day
It's all I need, that's all I need
Just a little bit baby

She's looking for a job and a finer place to stay,
She's looking for the hope in the empty promises
She's working two jobs, keeping alive,
She works in a restaurant night and day,
She waits her life away,
She wipes her tears away.
She cries inside everytime she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside everytime her baby cries
No...
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Killing up the life in the birds and the trees,
And we're suckin' up the air in the Earth from under me (it's never too late)
I can't even breathe (just lean on me),
I can't even see!
Keep your head up, don't give up, today!
How long can we wait?
I wish that love would come today!
All you need is love,
I tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, won't it do
Keep your head up!
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly (fly away, fly away, fly away)
Keep your head up, tonight!
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly, oh, my...
Everybody say that time is borrowed,
And hangin' down your head just ain't no good
And if you dare to rise above tomorrow
Just give yourself a chance,
Fight the circumstance,
Rise and do it again
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!
I need your love
I need you now
I need your light right here today
I need you now
Keeping your head up to the sky!
Keeping your mind to stay alive,
Give me your wings so we can fly
Keeping your head up to the sky,
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly!
Aaow!-hoo hoo!

I watch the snowflake fall
agenst my window plain
and wonder if you
are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is
[Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonley just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle bear(?)
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
[Chorus]
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)
[Chorus]
Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon...
A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair...
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head...
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain...
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair...
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there...
She knew no one cared...
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown...
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers...
Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live...
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, yeah baby
Say you will
Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause everyday that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry
Lonely teardrops, my pillow never dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, say you will, say you will
Come on, come on, say it right now baby
Come on, come on, say that you will
Come on, say it right now baby
Say that you will, come on, come on
Say that you will
Come on, come on, say that you will
Come on, come on, come on, say that you will
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tendeness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the lonelyness
Thar was waiting there
Spoken:
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away
(Spoken:)
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now
Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how cryin' has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I couldn't keep
(Spoken:)
My heart cries out for your tuch
But baby, you're not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you're gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby,
Every time I love you
In and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
So baby
Love never felt so good
Baby
Love never felt so fine (so fine)
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby
Love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby
Every time I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
if you really love
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
But baby
Love never felt so good
Baby
Love never felt so fine
And I'd die if you're mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Aww baby, love never felt so good, (so good)
And I'd die if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night through the thick and thin
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause
Baby
Every time I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
Cause baby
Love never felt so good
Never felt so good (oh)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good
It never felt so good
(Never felt so good)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good
Alright that's fine
Ah, I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my vein
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's so sad 'cause love's gone bad
I see a rainbow going black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night, callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see?
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me?
Where's the tenderness to comfort me?
Every time some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart's feeling sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Black crows flying up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Slime's on the land, slime's on the sea
Slime's not the last thing I'm destined to be
In this whole world where there's nothing right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart's feeling sad, love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad
Love's gone bad, heart's feeling sad...
Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
I'm crazy 'bout you
Wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desire
I get higher everytime I speak your name
All I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane
Chorus
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one!
Why don't you believe me when I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you
I'm here to love and please you
I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about you
Living and hoping, but I'm coping
With these things you put me through
All I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I do)
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you
Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you
When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane
Chorus
Hello, August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon, 'cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said if you're not well, stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
Hello, midnight lover you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish, and then we'll kiss, a love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
It seems you don't know we reached the hightened mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together, we will fly, we'll dance up in the heaven
I can really feel it when you're near(a uu)
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
'Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I stay home in bed
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
(I'll be loving you)Loving you, that's what I want to
(I'll be loving you)Loving you, thats what I want to do
Loving you, thats what I want to do
Loving you, thats what I want to do
Loving you, thats what I want to do(thats what I want to do)
(I'll be)Loving you, thats what I want to do(thats what i want to do)
(I'll be)Loving you, thats what I want to do
Loving you, thats what I want to do
Loving you, thats what I want to do
Oh baby, now I've been watchin' you, girl
When you dance you steal the show
Just like you stole my heart
When the lights were low
All the guys are waiting
Pleading just to hold you tight
Oh darling, no, no, no, please not tonight
'Cause now you're in my arms, girl
You thrill my soul, c'mon hold me close
Rock me slow
Baby, never let me go
Oh baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy, just gimme a try
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time
Make tonight all mine
(Baby I)
Can satisfy you
Gonna 'lectrify you
C'mon let me prove it
Show you I can do it
I've been walkin' like a shadow
Right behind you by myself
While you've been walking home
With someone else
Don't you know it hurts me
Seeing you with other guys
Oh darling, no, no, no, please not tonight
When the party's over, let me walk you home
I'll hold you close
Rock you slow
Never, never let you go
Oh baby, make tonight all mine
I can make you happy, just gimme a try
Oh, I've waited such a long, long time

Could it be really me, pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred,

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror, oh yeah
I'm asking him to change his ways, yeah
(Come on, change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
(You can't close your, your mind)
Then you close your mind
With the man in the mirror, oh yeah
(That man, that man, that man)
I'm asking him to change his ways
(Change)
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself then make that change
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good
Come on
(Change)
Just lift yourself
You know, you got to stop it yourself
(Yeah)
Make that change
(I gotta make that change today, oh)
(Man in the mirror)
You got to, you got to not let yourself, brother oh
Yeah, that man

You got to stand up, stand up, stand up

Stand up and lift yourself, now

(Gonna make that change, come on)
(Man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know
Change, make that change

Mind Is The Magic
Come in to me
I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets
All mysteries are parted
Life is a mirageghost
Imagination
Pure inspiration called justification
Nothing's impossible
Nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates wonders like nobody can?
Chorus:
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's
Siegfried & Roy
So be it
Siegfried & Roy
I'm gonna...
Siegfried & Roy
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you
Move of the head
And I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear
From euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening
Nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real
Seeing black panthers
That suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe
[Chorus]
'Cause when it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game
In the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
(Seeing is believin'...)
When it's Siegfried & Roy
It's the mind of a magic in true
Hallucinations
The game of this kind
This kind of magic
Throws mind
[Chorus]
Money
Money...
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust
But I say it's just
In the devil's game
Of greed and lust
They don't care
They'd do me for the money
They don't care
They use me for the money
So you go to church
Read the holy word
In the scheme of life
It's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag
Your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars
A soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but...
If you show me the cash
Then I will take it
If you tell me to cry
Then I will fake it
If you give me a hand
Then I will shake it
You do anything for money...
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi?
I don't think so
You don't care
You'd do her for the money
Say it's fair
You sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold
Need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul
Cuz your God is such
You don't care
You kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttoney and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers...
Cuz they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie
Then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt
Then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance
Then you will dare it
You do anything for money
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world
I don't think so
If you show me the man
Then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie
Then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God
Then you will hell him
You do anything for money
Anything...
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you, I
Even sell my soul to the devil
You can look at them coming out the walls
You can look at them climbing out the bushes
You can find them when the letter's bout to fall
He be waiting with his camera on focus

Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster

Catch me in a bad mood, flippin' you'll take a whippin'
Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addition
Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'
Shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it
Funeral's, cemeteries, don't worry it's time to visit
Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kidding
Its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
All hail, run tell, the King has risen
2010 Thriller, there's nothing iller, it's killer
There vision, the missin' the pack, this is that
This the bomb, ring the alarm
MJ number 1, it's goes on and on
Its goes on and on
We get to crippin', its running in the early morn'
Keep on dreaming there's nowhere to run
You can drive but you done
I can feel it in the air, hear the monster come.

She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking how that things won't be the same
And woudl you like to go with me
And she would answer no to me
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
I never thought
She'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And would you like to go with me
And she answered no to me
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
I hope to make a change now
for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And hoping that my prayers will see
The day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson
Much too soon
I've got sunshine
On a cloudy day
When it's cold outside
I've got the month of May
I guess you'd say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
(My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
I've got so much honey
the bees envy me
I've got a sweeter song than
the birds in the trees
I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
(My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
Hey hey hey
Hey hey hey
Ooooh...

Well I guess you'll say
What can make me feel this way?
My girl
(My girl, my girl)
Talkin' 'bout my girl
(My girl)
Never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That passes me right through the core
It says, "Turn around, you fool"
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
Oo oo, baby

No no no

Oh, I never can say goodbye

I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old, 'Did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time'
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Oo oo, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no

Oh, I'm never gonna say you goodbye, girl

When a lil' love was all I needed
U talkin'? I call it how I see it
And now I mean it
I'm out for good
Like a lot of u into movin out the hood
But if I told u take me back u would
Too late me and P like Pac & Suge

Spread some love like the Gold Rush
Is was the things you did that used to mean so much
Whatever u touched
The way you used to blush

Don't believe in such
Not since lovers don't promote violence
Not since just like the dolla no sense
No good I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this wanna suck my existence
But still I believe in U and Me
Quite frankly that's how it's supposed to be
That kinda love that could end any poverty
So I keep these ghost like the Kennedy's

When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feeling
Then there ain't no room for you, this part of town
'Cause we're the party people, night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
Groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin an' folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance an' do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people, night an' day
Livin' crazy that's the only way
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
Step on and Groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night, all right
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose, deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people, night and day
Livin' crazy that's the only way
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all
Live your life off the wall
So tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you livin' off the wall
Tonight
Gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
An' just enjoy yourself
C'mon and groove
Let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
Baby
Now I'm Mad
The World Treats Me Like An Everyday Dump
They Call Me Names, Threaten My Family
And I Always Say
On My Anger
On My Anger
Tonight
On My Anger
On My Anger
It's Gonna Be A Bite
Honey
What You Do To Me
You Strike Me Like A Lightning Bolt
And

No sense pretending its over
Hard times just don't go away
You gotta take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up
Have some faith
Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time
Yes it does
You gotta have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open mind
()
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
You've got to reach out and try
Gotta put your heart on the line
If you wanna make it right
Gotta put it all on the line
You see yourself in the mirror
And you don't like what you see
And things aren't getting much clearer
Don't you think it's time you go for a change
Don't waste your time on the past, no, no
It's time you look to the future
It's all right there if you ask
This time if you try much harder
You'll be the best that cou can be
()
Bridge
If you wanna make it right
If you wanna do it now
You gotta learn to try
You can make it right somehow
Let love come free
And that's just so easy now
You gotta go for what you want
You gotta do what you got to do
One day in your life
You'll remember a place
Someone touching your face
You'll come back and you'll look around, you'll
One day in your life
You'll remember the love you found here
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you're always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
You'll remember me somehow
Though you don't need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You'll remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you're always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I'll be there
Uh huh alright
This time gonna do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side
Hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold I need someone
Oh why oh why why why
If you see her
tell her this from me
All I need is
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(See)
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
(Alright)
One more chance at love
Searching for that one who is going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold
Hold on
Lightning about to strike in rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe
Oh why why
If you see her
Tell her this from me
All I need is
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more chance for love)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
(One more)
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no
Why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See tell her this from me
One more chance at love
(Yeah, Yeah)
One more chance at love

One more chance at love

Everybody's talkin' 'bout ecology
The air's so polluted that it's hard to breathe

Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They'd swear you're a hippy if you have long hair

Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart, soft and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.
In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now
Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart, gentle and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you.

Ain't the pictures enough?
Why do you go through so much
To get the story you need,
So you can bury me?
You've got the people confused
You tell the stories you choose
You try to get me to lose
The man I really am.
You keep on stalking me
Invading my privacy
Won't you just let me be?
'Cause your cameras can't control
The minds of those who know
That you'll even sell your soul just to get a story sold
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
Some of you still wonder why
One of my friends had to die
To get a message across
That yet you haven't heard
My friend was chased and confused
Like many others I knew
But on that cold winter night
My pride was snatched away
She get no second chance
She just ridiculed and harassed
Please tell my why
Now there's a lesson to learn
Respect's not given, it's earned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
Now there's a lesson to learn
Stories are twisted and turned
Stop maliciously attacking my integrity
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me
I need my privacy
I need my privacy
So paparazzi
Get away from me

Girl, close your eyes
Let that rhythm get into you
Don't try to fight it
There ain't nothin' that you can do
Relax your mind
Lay back and groove with mine
You got to feel that heat
And we can ride the boogie
Share that beat of love
I wanna rock with you (all night)
Dance you into day (sunlight)
I wanna rock with you (all night)
We're gonna rock the night away

Knew it from the day I met you were the one
But I guess I let you know too soon
'Cause now every day you want to bring it up
Stressing me to settle down with you
Pre-chorus:
You know it's getting on my nerves
It's like you never hear a single word
Listen close to me
You'll be the first to know, girl, once I'm ready
Chorus:
I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Sometimes you need to step outside the game
If you want to win it in the end
'Cause I'm down for you until we share my name [yes I am]
So you need to stop the questioning
Pre-chorus:
(And you know that) You know it's getting on my nerves [oh yeah]
It's like you never hear a single word [yeah]
Listen close to me
You'll be the first to know, girl, once I'm ready
Chorus:
I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away [time away]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe [to breathe]
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you [hurting you]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Better believe a little distance will only bring me closer to you
And I know it might be hard for you to hear, but here's what we've gotta do
We need to take a little time to see what is meant to be
So just give me some room to breathe
Chorus:
I don't wanna go (go) I don't wanna stay (stay)
Think I need a little time away [think I need a little time]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
Only then I'll know (know) what I gotta do (do)
'Cause right now I'm only hurting you [yeah]
Hope you understand (why) this is what I need (so)
Give me some room to breathe
[I thought I told you girl]
[I got to get some room]
[Yeah babe]
[Oh]
[Just give me some room]

She's got the look
She's so fine
And you know damn well
The girl will be mine
She's got the breaks
She's the scene
And you know damn well
She gives it to me (uh-huh)
Black jeans and
A turtleneck sweater
I know the girl
Is fakin' 'cause
I've seen her look better
She's composition
She's statistical fact
She got it ready for the willing
Got it kicking of the back
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Wanting no break time

Come to the place
Shock tacy
And you know damn well
You know what I mean
Hot in the face
One to 3
Like a pleasure trip
Like you've never seen (uh-huh)
Satin lace
And a paisley cut top
The girl is wasting over
'cos she knows she looks hot
She's got position
She's got just what it takes
Got a mojo in her pocket
Got it ready just in case
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild
Please no, keep back
I can't take it
You're driving me wild
I might not make it
You got me looking like buckwheat
(oh) hair pulled
Every which way but neat
Far from medusa
But you looks are deadly
Your walk is soft
Still I hear the medley
Oh, shiver me timberland boots
Cramp my style
She drives me wild
She's got the look
She's got the look
(She's got the look)
She's got the look
Wanting no break time
She's got the look
She's driving me wild

She's Out Of My Life
She's Out Of My Life
And I Don't Know Whether To Laugh Or Cry
I Don't Know Whether To Live Or Die
And It Cuts Like A Knife
She's Out Of My Life
It's Out Of My Hands
It's Out Of My Hands
To Think For Two Years She Was Here
And I Took Her For Granted I Was So Cavalier
Now The Way That It Stands
She's Out Of My Hands
So I've Learned That Love's Not Possession
And I've Learned That Love Won't Wait
Now I've Learned That Love Needs Expression
But I Learned Too Late
She's Out Of My Life
She's Out Of My Life
Damned Indecision And Cursed Pride
Kept My Love For Her Locked Deep Inside
And It Cuts Like A Knife
She's Out Of My Life
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me.
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encased like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is building and I've had enough
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now
She dances for the man at work
Who works her overtime
She can't be rude as she says
Sir, "I must be home tonight"
She dances to the kitchen stove
Dinner is served by nine
He says his food's an hour late
She must be outta her mind
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
She works so hard, just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
A a slave to the rhythm of
The rhythm of love, the rhythm of love
As he came into the window
Was the sound of a Crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

(Who's watching me?)
I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price
All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the twilight zone?
And
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?
When I'm in the shower, I'm afraid to wash my hair
Ã¢E Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much
That's why
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching me?)
I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)
Well is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)
And I don't feel safe anymore, oh what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now
(Who?!)
The IRS?!
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me, who can it be?
(Who's watching?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
(Who's watching me?)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Can I have my privacy?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?
Written and composed by Michael Jackson
(Opening Version)
All alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who'd be my friend
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you
Promise me we'll always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
(Closing Version)
Though you're gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I'll remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tears
When someone in the dark reaches out for you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I'll look up and see
Someone in the dark for me!
I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside
The truth is that I'm longing
For love that's so devine
I search this whole world wishing shell be there
Time after time
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
I've lived my life a lonely
A soul that cries of shame
In handicaped emotions save me now
While the wound still remains
I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I' m just needing at someone save me now
Come out of my mind
Someone Put Your Hand Out
Begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out
(I'm begging for your love)
Begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
When you say we will dance until the light of day
It's just like the children of earth's joy
When we pray
Will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
A heart that needs your love
Someone Put Your Hand Out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out love
There's a feeling here inside
That I cannot hide and I know I've tried
But it's turning me around
I'm not sure that I'm aware
If I'm up or down, or here or there
I need both feet on the ground
Maybe I'm just going crazy
Letting myself get up-tight
I'm acting just like a baby
But I'm gonna be, I'm gonna be alright
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
Soon as I get home
In a different place, in a different time
Different people around me
I would like to know of that different world
And how different they find me
And just what's a Wiz, is it big? Will it scare me?
If I ask to leave, will the Wiz even hear me?
How will I know then
If I'll ever get home again?
Here I am alone, though it feels the same
I don't know where I'm going
I'm here on my own and it's not a game
And now a strange wind is blowing
I'm so amazed at the things that I see here
Don't want to be afraid, I just don't wanna be here
In my mind this is clear what am I doing here?
I wish I was home
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, like "I love you."
I'm headed for the border
It's on my mind
And nothin' really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks
Is he getting nearer
I feel some heat is on my back

Miscellaneous
Stranger In Moscow
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittlin' me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
And again, and again, and again...
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel (How does it feel)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel (How does it feel now)
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside

In the news today, from the strange and weird fact file,
Singer Michael Jackson sleeps in an oxygen chamber,
The singer says that the hyperbaric chamber has the benefit of reversing
The aging process...
Speculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
So why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual
In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
She's blonde and she's bisexual
Scandal
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men
Then why do we keep foolin' ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
You're so damn disrespectable

(repeat chorus to end)
You take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Something else to do
You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Heart on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea
Snkaes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
I watch the snowflake fall
against my window pain
and wonder if you
are watching snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas eve
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a little prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
[Chorus]
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)
[Chorus]
Written & composed: charlie smalls
Music: charlie smalls
Put your arms around me child,
Like when you bumped your shin;
Then you'll know I love you now,
As I loved you then
Though you may be trying sometimes,
And I'll need you and you're not there;
You know I may get mad and turn away,
But you know that I still care
But you cannot ask for me,
Than can come from me;
I am older than you are,
And one day you'll see
If I lose my patience with you,
And I suddenly start to scream;
It's only because I just want you to be
Everything I see in my dreams
Chorus :
And I'd like to know it's there,
The feeling that we have,
When you know that you can come running to me,
Whenever times are bad
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Don't lose the feeling that we have
Though you're growing older now,
And I'm watching you grow;
I know I make you sad sometimes,
And I see your feelings show.
But one day I'll look around,
And you will be grown;
You'll be out in the world,
Such a pretty girl,
But you'll be on your own
Chorus :
And I'd like to know it's there,
The feeling that we have;
Knowing that you can come to me
Whenever you are sad
Child, I'd like to know it's there,
The feel that we have-
Don't lose the feeling that we have.
Don't lose the feeling that we have
I Wanna groove...I Wanna groove. I Wanna groove girl
Get in to the groove baby. Get in to the groove. I Wanna touch you girl
I Wanna touch you baby.
In the future, I Wanna be with you forever, baby
In the future, I Wanna be with you...
I Wanna groove...I Wanna groove. I Wanna groove with you girl.
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The Girl Is Mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine
(Paul)
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
(Paul)
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
(Michael)
But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
(Michael & Paul)
So come and go with me
To one town
(Michael)
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
(Paul)
I don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
(Michael)
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
(Michael)
The Girl Is Mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
(Michael & Paul)
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
(Paul)
The Girl Is Mine, (yep) she's mine
The Girl Is Mine, (yep) she's mine
(Michael)
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The Girl Is Mine, The Girl Is Mine
(Paul)
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay
(Michael)
Paul, I think I told you, I'm a lover not a fighter
(Paul)
I've heard it all before, Michael, she told me that I'm her forever lover, you know
don't you remember
(Michael)
Well, after loving me, she said she couldn't love another
(Paul)
Is that what she said
(Michael)
Yes, she said it, you keep dreaming
(Paul)
I don't believe it
(Michael & Paul)
The Girl Is Mine (mine, mine, mine)
Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock)
I know she's mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock)
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
It's really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
(She mine, she mine, she mine)
The doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock)
Don't waste your time
(Your time, don't waste your time, don't, your time, don't)
Because the doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock)
I love you more than he
(Take you anywhere)
But I love you endlessly
(Loving we will share)
So come and go with me
To another town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
Don't build your hopes to be let down

'Cause she says I blow her mind
The girl is mine

Because the doggone girl is mine
(She like the way I rock, the way I rock
The way I rock, the way I rock)
She love the way, I love her low, the way I love her high
(Love her high)
She love to say hello and never say goodbye
(Say goodbye)
I call her mommy and she call me papa
I'm sorry Mike, but she love the way I rock her
And you know, you know, you know I really care
(You know, you know, you know I care)

We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing
So this ones for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because Im keeping a place
For all The Lost Children
This is for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee
So pray for all The Lost Children
Lets pray for all The Lost Children
Just think of all The Lost Children, wishing them well
This is for all The Lost Children
This ones for all The Lost Children
Just think of all The Lost Children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home
Stop! Na na na! You'd better save it
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed
They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name to dirt, oh
Isaac said he kissed you
Beneath the apple tree
When Benjie held your hand he felt
Electricity
When Alexander called you
He said he rang your chimes
Christopher discovered
You're way ahead of your times
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for a danger zone
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
Slow down
S is for "Save it"
T is for "Take it slow"
O is for "Oh, no!"
P is for "Please, please, don't go!"
The love you save may be your own
Some day you may be all alone
Stop it
Save it, girl
Baby! Ooooh
You'd better stop! the love you save may be your own
Please, please
Or some day, some day baby, you'll be all alone
I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed
Ahh
Stop! The love you save may be your own, baby
You'd better stop it, stop it, stop it girl
Or someday you'll be all alone
The way they talk about you
They'll turn your name, turn your name to dirt
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Don't cha know don't cha know
Some day baby you'll be all alone
Wait a while
Those other guys will put you down as soon as they succeed
J5: Stop! Nanana! You'd better save it!
Stop, stop, stop, you'd better save it!
Michael: When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be It.
But chasing boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart you'd quit.
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing!
CHORUS:
Stop! The love you save may be your own!
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone.
You'd better stop the love you save may be your own!
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone.
Michael: I'm the one who loves you!
I'm the one you need!
Jermaine: Those other guys will put you down As soon as they succeed!

There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
Ooh, there's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell, ooh
And it's just the way he
Thought it would be
'cause the day has come
For him to be free
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
There's a man
Everybody thought they knew
Ooh, there's such a man
He's not like me and you, ooh
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
And it's just the way she
Thought it would be
As he says, something has
Happened to me
Then he laughs, he kicks
And rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
(this is the man)
Ooh yeah
(ooh, yeah)
This is the man
(this is the man)
This is the man
This is the sample
An this is the melody
(Hollywood Tonight sample)
One, two, three, four...
We're takin' over
We have the truth
This is the mission
To see it through
Don't point your finger
Shiii!
Not dangerous
This is our planet
You're one of us
We're sendin' out
A major love
And this is our
Message to you (message to you)
The planets are linin' up
We're bringin' brighter days
They're all in line
Waitin' for you
Can't you see...?
You're just another part of me...
(Hee, hee)
Shiii! Shiii! Shiii! Shiii!
Aow!
Damn...
I don't do this for fun man
It's my job, dawg
All you see is the videos and the rings and the watch
And the bracelet, and chains
And you know, grills and more chains
Another chain on top of that
And another ring on another finger, and another grill
And then I switch grills and then I change chains
And that's all you see, but you know
'Ey
I wake up early in the morning
Hit the snooze button for hours
Get up, hop into a two hundred thousand dollar shower
Brush my teeth when I'm out it
Remote start the Audi
Kiss my boy, kiss my girl, kiss my wife, and then I'm outtie
Damn
Grind time from a struggle to a hussle
"Aw man"s to "God damn"s
From a clam to a mussel
I ain't say you had it better
But damn, did I tussle
I ain't have much
But if you tried to take it, I'll bust ya
It feels like I done died
'Cause every time I drive my past life flash
Right in front of my eyes
'Cause I'm not one of them guys
That don't remember shit,
Can't even go home and drive alone in this whip
'Cause everybody want him gone
But you got me fucked up
If a nigga gon' be on YouTube saying'
I ain't from my bowin' homes [?]
So I'm gonna keep goin' strong
And let you niggas go out of season
As long as my kids is breathin'
I'm doing this for a lot of reason
I do it for my kids and they kids' kids
And when I'm dead they come to my grave
To tell me what they kids did, yeah
I'mma tell 'em my style and how long I has hated on about it
And how it took twenty minutes to make a song about it
Even though I was young I was actin' grown about it
Took some years, but eventually they left me 'lone about it
Old folks cheering' me on 'cause they know I got it
They see niggas get in the game and fold like origami
But the only foldin' I'm doin' is when I'm at shows poppin'
Got 'em fainting' like Michael Jackson, straight hos droppin'
Then I go home, safely homie, there's no robbin'
Gated community
You gotta know the code, partna
Walk up to the crib
Lamborghini look so proper
And six old-schools sittin' on 24" choppas
White folks in my neighborhood think I'm the Dalai Lama
'Specially when I come outside like roo sticky dima [?]
But everything good gotta turn bad
It's like the weekly drama,
You know, lil' small shit,
Like girls saying' they my baby mama
But this music has made me calmer
I now understand karma
These niggas is mad,
They wanna assassinate me
Like Barack Obama
But I graduated, School of Hard Knocks, summa cum laude
On the side of the stage
Like I am really 'bout to fuck this crowd up
That makes me prouder, makes me a man
If you ain't doin' what I'm' doin'
You automatically a fan
Damn, get on your knees please
And praise God that he sent you somebody
That can just tell you niggas these things
Radio Killa, R&B King, T.P.

You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk
Your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car
And we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
I like the feeling you're giving me
Just hold me baby and I'm in ecstasy
Oh I'll be working from nine to five
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
Go on girl!
Go on! Hee! Hee! Aaow!
Go on girl!
I never felt so in love before
I promise baby, you'll love me forever more
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me...
The way you make me feel
(The way you make me feel)
You really turn me on
(You really turn me on)
You knock me off of my feet
(You knock me off of my feet)
My lonely days are gone
(My lonely days are gone)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
(The way you make me fell)
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby
(You really turn me on) Hee hee!
(You knock me off of my feet) Hee hee! Ooh!
(My lonely days are gone)
Give it to me, give me some time
(The way you make me feel)
Come on be my girl, I wanna be with mine
(You really turn me on)
Ain't nobody's business
(You knock me off of my feet)
Ain't nobody's business, but mine and my baby's
Go on girl! Aaow!

(Michael Jackson / Randy Jackson / Jackie Jackson / Tito Jackson / Marlon Jackson)
People all over the world are the same everywhere I go
I give in to this, I give in to that
Every day it bothers me so
Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the extreme
Am I being used
I just need a clue
I don't know which way to go
So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, he don't know
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, she don't know
Five minutes later I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
Always wanting something for nothing
Especially what they don't deserve
Reaching in my pocket
I just got to stop it
Even though they got a lot of nerve
Am I in a bad situation
People taking me to the extreme
They don't use rejection
So I need protection
To keep my equity
So I took my problems to a doctor
So he could check it out, he don't know
Took it to a palm reader so she could
Read my hand, she don't know
Five minutes later I started to understand
I started screaming, shouting, acting mad
No one could help me but myself
But I gave everything I had
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
It's things I do for you
In return do the same for me
I watch the snowflake fall
against my window pain
and wonder if you
are watching snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas eve
I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a little prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there All alone on Christmas eve
This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)
[Chorus]
Just a little Christmas tree Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me No one seems to care They just went away and left it standing there All alone on Christmas eve
Ready?
One, two, three, ahh!
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world
I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know, yes for sure
It is real
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with their eyes
But you say you're gonna leave it for yourself
Ohhh!
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand
This is it
I can say
I'm the light of your world
Run away
We can feel
This is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me that you don't want me hanging around
Many times wanna do it here before
Oh, yeah!
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on baby just understand
This is it
I can feel
I'm the light of the world
This is real
Feel my song
We can say
And I tell you can feel that way
And I feels as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you saw my face for yourself
And you said want to go with me on a while
And I know that it's really for myself
Oh, yeah!
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on please dear understand
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on dear please understand
Oh, yeah!
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan...
Live in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promise I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
As we walked to the room
There were faces starring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scarring me
We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
(Sitting in my room)
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I'm undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought
In beguile to hurt me
This is scaring me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me
We came to this place
Where the vicious dwelt
Found that wicked women
(Run this strange hotel)
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through

This time around I'll never get bit
Though you really wanna fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really wanna get me
Somebody's out
Somebody's out to get me
They really wanna fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit

(The Notorious BIG)
Listen, I've got problems of my own
Flashin' cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home I ain't safe as I should be
Things always missin'
Maybe it could be my friends
They ain't friends if they robbin' me
Stoppin' me from makin' a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun totin'
If I was dead broke and smokin'
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'm a killer nigga I ain't jokin'
Endo smoke got me choked and I'm hopin'
The fool comes slippin'
So I could blow'em open
This time around
I changed up my flow
Got rid of the rocks
Got pits by the door
I've raised other peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers
So I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby
This time around yeah...
He really thought he really had
Control of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had
A hold on me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had
Had a hold on me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had
Control of me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had
A hold on me
He really thought he really had
They thought they really had control of me
This time around yeah
He really thought
Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster.
You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed
I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I know just what you said
That's why you've got to be Threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel Threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be Threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, Threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel Threatened by me
You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be Threatened by me
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in tow places at the same time
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear.
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare.
It isn't. It's the beginning.
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurkin'in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller at night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller at night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with the forty eyes, girl

They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial

Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell

Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight

The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
It's close to midnight, and something evil's lurkin' in the dark

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame,
Not set, the pace for style
If I can follow through
on, what they gave me as my tools,
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools
If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
Ive done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me, myself
So he can do or else
(Of without compromise,
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man the way
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared that are a shame
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and a woman's youngest son
while growing, still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smile...
(Proud)
Como la brisa
Tu voz me acaricia y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece
Tu amor aparece y me hace feliz
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambiÃ©n
Que nadie te querrÃ¡ como yo
TÃº me haces sentir deseos de vivir
Junto a ti por siempre
Tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama
Y tÃº eres quien gana
En mi corazÃ³n
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado
Con tu pasiÃ³n
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambiÃ©n
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida
Si tÃº te vas
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay quien me de lo que das tÃº
Pues todo mi amor eres tÃº
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo sÃ©
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambiÃ©n
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay quien me de lo que das tÃº
Pues todo mi amor eres tÃº
Cambiaremos al mundo maÃ±ana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adiÃ³s a la tristeza
Es mi vida y quiero estar junto a ti
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
(Now, baby, oh)
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
(If I ain't? t stop)
Cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay quien me de lo que das tÃº
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Todo mi amor eres tÃº
Cuando no estÃ¡s
No hay quien me de lo que das tÃº
She said that the body she was born, it was wrong kind
She wears black, red and all that, to hide who she is inside
Tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, you are accepted the way you're
There's no one, to tell you otherwise, keep your head up high
Tomboy, tomboy, tomboy, you are moon you are a star
You shine to peoples lives, bring back the the hope and a smiles
There's no one, to tell you can't
Because you can if you want
No one can let you down and tell you can't
To be that you feel in your heart
They try to tell us we're too young
Too young to really be in love
They say that love's a word
A word we've only heard
But can't begin to know the meaning of
And yet we're not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then someday they may recall
We were not to young at all
It was on a street so evil
So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watching
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walking
Told me I should not have come there
Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
'Cause I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture
She was up a stair to nowhere
A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here
Is simply for the thrill you're after
Loneliness or hearts of fire
I am here to serve all masters
She said reality is a knife
When there's no love in your life
And merciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture
And I still can't find the meaning, no no no
Of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel, start the flame in me
Baby, 'cause you cut me like a knife
Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feelin'
It's torture, it's torture, it's torture
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture
If I had a penny for everytime
I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel for everytime
I didn't understand
I'd be the world poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you're willing do
If I had only reach out
I might still be touching you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
(You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you)
Would get embarrased for every time
I've moved and make you cry
You get sentimental, and
I would never know the reason why
I hold the world sings
Making for my selfish pride
Is it really over
When I get close to you
I only want to show you
That i'm learning a thing or two
If you want the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to...
(Fade out)
I don't wanna move when I'm in your hands
There's nothing I can do or say
Put everything on hold, cancelled all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away, hey
She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants
She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it
I never know what's running trough her mind
No tellin' what she's gonna do
Her every move is like a dancer sign
Darlin' me to come on through, hey
She may be bad but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants
She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble
She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm fallin'
(You're in trouble)
Trouble, there's no hope in sight
I'm in way over my head
She's trouble, I know it
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble, I know it
She's trouble, I love it
I know that when she does it
I'm in trouble, I know it
I know it

mother cries desperatly, our baby's gone!
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street.
Just imagine how scared they are
She wrote that it's positive that they're using her
singing by her face, while sexually abusing her
just think she's out all alone on the streets
how did this girl survive
she got nothing
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street.
Just imagine how scared they are
Save me from this day now
save me cause I don't know what to do
save me from (?) a man
save me from cause I don't wanna go
As shes on the move she off to Hollywood
she said she wanna be a star she heard the money's good
she gets off at the train station, the man is waiting there
I'll show you where the money is
girl just let down your hair
hes taking her on the streets of sunset boulevard
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it's not 12 o'clock, and they're somewhere out on the street.
Just imagine how scared they are

Miscellaneous
Unbreakable
Now I'm just wondering why you think
That you can get to me with anything
Seems like you'd now by now
When and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
Now you can't stop me even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', while surfacing
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm stll gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'm a still remain the same, I'm unbreakable
Uh, uh, what, uh
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them
HELLO?!
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert E's street sweepers inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
Into each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed my side
You make the sun shine

I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you
This Humpty Dumpty's lucky
He's had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this time
Refrain
I'm up again I never let you down
Nothing's ever gonna stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you

I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always tryin'
To keep my baby cryin'
Treacherous, cunnin', declinin'
You got my baby cryin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
It's too high to get over (Yeah, yeah)
Too low to get under (Yeah, yeah)
You're stuck in the middle (Yeah, yeah)
And the pain is thunder (Yeah, yeah)
You're a vegetable
You're a vegetable
Still they hate you
You're a vegetable
You're just a buffet
You're a vegetable
They eat off of you
You're a vegetable
Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'

Then don't have a baby (Yeah, yeah)
And don't think maybe (Yeah, yeah)
If you can't feed your baby (Yeah, yeah)
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustlin', stealin', lyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

Lift your head up high
And scream out to the world
I know I am someone
And let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now
Because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me
So you believe in you

Feeling like this is the end of the world
Missing on the chance to fall in love (I do got it)
Feeling like your love is dangerous, but I love you, girl
Feeling like I'm never good enough
Let the heaven open, it's raining in heaven
Feels like warm july
We'll be something new, I'm here for you
And there's no need to cry
Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my love, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?
Feeling like this is the start of something new
Feeling like this is the world of me and you
Cause you ain't judging me, you just touching me
You ain't bugging me, I'm waiting on you
I'm hoping it's true, baby, it's you
When the storm is ranging
We can walk the moon
Girl, I love you, you're my fortune
You keep me alive
Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my soul, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?
I lie awake, I count the days
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes away
I'd rather stay, I rather play again
When I'm not there with you forever, always
(Water, water)
Don't you do this to me
Tell the angels no
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
Won't you leave us alone
Tell the angels no
I don't wanna leave my baby alone
It feels like, leave us alone
(Water, water)
Leave us alone, it feels like
(Water, water)
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
(Water, water, water)
(It's like water, water)
All over me, it's all over me
(It's like water, water, like water)
All over me, it's all over me, it's all
All over me (water)
It's all over me
(Water, it's like water, water)
We're on a mission
In the everlasting light that shines a revelation
Of the truth in chapters of our minds
So long, bad times
We're gonna shake it up and break it up
We're sharing light brighter than the sun
Hello, good times
We're here to simulate, eliminate
An' congregate, illuminate
(We Are Here To Change The World)
Gonna change the world, Hee
(We Are Here To Change The World)
Gonna change the world, Ooo
So do surrender
'Cause the power's deep inside my soul
Sing it

Gonna change the world, Sing it

Hee, Deep down in my body
deep down in my soul, Baby
(We Are Here To Change The World)
Hee, We're gonna change the world, Ooo
There comes a time,
When we head a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on
Pretending day by day
That someone, somehow will soon make a change
We are all a part of
God's great big family
And the truth, you know love is all we need
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making,
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Send them your heart,
So they'll know that someone cares
So there cries for help
Will not be in vein
We can't let them suffer
No we cannot turn away
Right now they need a helping hand
Nou se mond la
We are the Children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
When you're down and out
There seems no hope at all
But if you just believe
There's no way we can fall
Well, well, well, well, let us realize
That a change can only come
When we stand together as one
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
Got to start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We are the world
We are the children
Its for the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So lets start giving
There's a choice we're making

So let's start giving
Choice were making
saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
We all need somebody that we can lean on
When you wake up look around and see that your dreams gone
When the earth quakes we'll help you make it through the storm
When the floor breaks a magic carpet to stand on
We are the World united by love so strong
When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the World connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me
Everyday citizens
Everybody pitching in
Nou se mond la
Nou se timoun yo
You and I
You and I
Uh, 12 days no water
Wishing will to live
We amplified the love we watching multiply
Feeling like the Worlds end
We can make the World win
Like Katrina, Africa, Indonesia
and now Haiti needs us, the need us, they need us
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we make a better day
Just you and me
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti, Haiti, Ha, Ha, ha, ha, ha
Haiti.
Nothing you can say
Nothing you can do
We'll be ballin you
We'll be ballin you
No one can it...
And see what you're goin' through
We'll be ballin you
We'll be ballin you
Step back when I slap on the mike like that
Came from the ghetto and now it's a better man
I got an... trick using my white head
...
I came up the disco when I go near
My game it kills Am I for real
I'm the Michael Jack the rap I close the deal
Getting' grey in a... I'm gonna steal your wheel
Gonna... me a MILF... for my boys to kill
I love this stuff...
It ain't easy pippin' it pippin' it and pay the bill
I'm ballin you and I'm... a century
I'm ballin too...
No matter how hard
The task may seem
Don't give up our plans
Don't give up our dreams
No broken bridges
Can turn us around
Cause what we're searchin' for
Will soon be found
Refrain
Cause we're almost there
Just one more step
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
(Just one more step)
Don't give up
'Cause we're almost all almost there
('Cause we're almost there)
(Look at the lovers)
Look at the lonely lovers
That didn't make it
Life's long hard climb
(Life's long hard climb)
They just couldn't take it
(They just couldn't take it)
Don't let it happen to me and you
Hold on together, darlin'
We'll make it through
Darlin', keep on reachin' out for me
Keep on reachin, do it for me
Do it for me, cause baby
Refrain
('Cause we're almost there)
(We're almost there)
('Cause we're almost there)
We're so close
I can taste it
A life so sweet
Can't afford to waste it
(Can't afford to waste it)
Need to feel your hand
Slippin' from mine?
Just hold on tighter now, darlin'
Keep on tryin'
Refrain
Baby, do it for me, do it do it baby
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
(We're almost there)
Don't give up
(Cause we're almost there)
Just one more step
Baby baby, don't give up
('Cause we're almost there)
Keep on, keep on
(We're almost there)
Just one more step
('Cause we're almost there)
Cause we're almost there
(Instrumental)
Juste one more step
Cause we're almost there
We've come to far
To turn around
Ooh!
Keep on reachin'
For higher ground
We've had our ups and we've had our downs
Let nothin' in the world darlin'
Turn us around
Cause we're almost there
We're almost there
We're almost there
Everything we're lookin' for
We're almost there
Keep on reachin' out for me
Cause we're almost there darlin'

We're almost there darlin'
We're almost there
We're almost there
Ah we're almost there
Yeah yeah
Alright
Love hurt, love hurt
Yeah yeah
Hey my girl
She did something to my chemistry
And when I'm close I'm sure
I raise her temperature by 3 degrees
Everyday in everyway
She makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin her
So we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And I don't have to ask
Cause I know it's
Gonna last eternally
(Now let me tell you what we got)
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use
We're making nice
You see we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And she don't have to ask
Cause she know it's
Gonna last eternally
Said we got a
Good good good good good
thing going yeah yeah
That girl and me
together...
(We've got forever, forever)
I'll plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dreams that we're dreaming
Have time to come true
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
We shall have music
We shal have rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time
Then we'll add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and you
'cause we've got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dimlight
From one more violent crime
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did god say that you could decide?
You saw he didn't run
And that my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shakin
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids
We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only god could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that can't be done
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in my soul baby
Deep in your soul and let God decide
Deep in my soul
It's up to me and i'm still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
Just let God decide,
It's going on baby
Just let God decide
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough
What goes around, comes around
I've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near
But then you drifted away
After you said you'd always stay
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I've had no love affairs
For three long years
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears
Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you
Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown
Yeah, yeah, baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Na na baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
He gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been goin' on
She says
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they've been doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy,"
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't you let go baby
Don't you don't you let go
Can I get quick dance baby
Don't you let go baby
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand
Thank you, man!
Thank you, Carlos!

(adlib and fade out)
Where have I been?
What should i be looking for?
What am I gonna be when I come of age?
Will I be strong?
Will I de a mighty man
Climb mountains if I can
When I come of age?
Hey y'all I think I'll be a movie star
Or travel to some distant star
Yeah that's it I'm gonna be an astronaut
And rock it to the moon
And then I'll be the captain of a giant ship
I'm gonna take a long, long trip to far off land
When I become a man
And what about love?
Will you still be in love with me?
I sure hope you will be
When I come of age
And will you be true?
Will you still want to marry me?
I guess I'll have to wait and see
When I come of age
My folks say I'm too young for love
But they don't seem to understand
That what I feel is love for somebody
A feeling I understand
And while I've fot this feeling
It's you, girl, you're so grand
And I'll love you girl just as strong
When I come of age
Wait, be patient honey
You've got to believe in me
Wait, wait for me baby
It'll be just you and me
We'll do all the things
We couldn't do before
When when I come of age
We're gonna be so happy
When, when I come of age
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold
And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will i do?
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
(who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(who is it?)
Is it my brother!
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will i do!
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
(who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(who is it?)
Is it my brother?
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause i'm lonely
(who is it?)
It is friend of mine
(who is it?)
To me i'm bothered
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take it 'cause i'm lonely
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seen right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me

Who's looking for a lover?
Who's looking for a lover?
Early this morning while I was yawning
I got a warning thought
Somebody near me who doesn't fear me
Knows things I ain't been taught
Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody smart wants my young heart
Our will is done, our will is done
Who's looking for a lover?
Who'll pick me out from all the crowd?
What thrills will I discover?
Will I be scared or do myself proud?
Who's looking for a lover?
Who's looking for a lover?
Maybe some honey just wants my money
Hey that's a funny tought
Someone appealing could set me reeling
And get my feeling caught
Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song
Who's looking for a lover?
Who wants to know what I can do?
Who's looking for a lover?
I'm looking everywhere for you
Somebody older somebody bolder
Wants to get hold of me, yeah
Somebody strong help me belong
Answer my song, answer my song
Who's looking for a lover?
Who'll pick me out from all the crowd?
What thrills will I discover?
Will I be scared or do myself proud?
Looking Out

Hold me

you are my friend
Carry me
like you are my brother,
love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary
Tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
a man should be faithful,
and walk when not able,
and fight till the end,
but I'm only human!
Everyone taking control of me,
seems that the world's
got a role for me
I'm so confused
will you show to me,
you be there for me,
and care enough to bear me!
(Hold me)
(Lay your head lowly)
(Softly then boldly) (Yeah!)

When weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?

Anytime you want to leave your world behind
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
Just take my hand and together we'll touch the sky
Just climb on the wings of my love
Yes remember I will always be around
I'll take you high on the wings of my love
With a child's heart
Go face the worries of the day
With a child's heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With a child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You've got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy nice and easy
Like a child so gay and so carefree
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me down
Ooh my honey

Xscape
Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The systems in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can clear my mind
Xscape is what I need, away from electric eyes
No matter where I am, I seen my face around
They pin lies on my name, and push them from town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place
So I won't hide away
Xscape, got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape, the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
Xscape, the man with the pen that writes the lies that hassle this man
Xscape, I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Xscape
I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, its time to make a change
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to? (oh)
Went in my personal life and I don't live for you (you)
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me (try it)
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to
Xscape, (hoo-hoo) (oh, no)
got to get away from a system loose in the world today
(I've got to get away)
Xscape
the pressure that I face from relationships that go away
(don't you know I need it?)
Xscape

(I've got to get away)
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
(get away)
Xscape
(don't you try it)
got to get away from a system lose in the world today
Xscape

Xscape (auow!)
Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now its all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the life
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life
Now I wake up everyday
With this smile upon my face
No more tears, no more pain
'Cause you love me
You help me understand
That love is the answer to all that I am
And I, I'm a better man
Since you taught me by sharing your life
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life
You gave me strength
When I wasnt strong
You gave me hope when all hope was lost
You opened my eyes when I couldnt see
Love was always here waiting for me
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (I love you)
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You are the sun
You make me shine
Or more like the stars
That twinkle at night (I love you)
You are the moon
That glows in my heart
You're my daytime my nighttime
My world
You're my life
Another day has gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be? You're not here with me
You never said good-bye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold?
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
All alone, why, oh...
Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come, and hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
Oh... whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
Fly... and girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
That you are not alone (That you are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
I am here to stay (I am here to stay)
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone...
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Not alone oh
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me
Not alone
Oh together together
Gotta stop being alone
Gotta stop being alone
Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did you slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
All alone
Why?
O-o-oh ...
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear you prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday I sit and ask myself

Something whispers in my ear and says

I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'

You're always in my heart
(You are not alone) you are not alone
(I am here with you) I am here with you
(Though you're far away) though you're far away
(I am here to stay)
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
Another day has gone

How could this be you're not here with me

You are so beautiful, You make me shine
I feel so happy now, because of you...
You are my children and i love you
you make me speechless, what can i do...
You're so beautiful.
You were there, before we came.
You took the hurt, you took the shame.
They built the walls to block your way.
You beat them down.
You won the day.
It wasn't right, it wasn't fair.
You taught them all.
You made them care.
Yes, you were there, and thanks to you
There's now a door we all walk through.
And we are here, for all to see --
To be the best that we can be.
Yes, I am here...
Because you were there.
Just because you know I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you're sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna see you in mysery, so come on, baby come on
Refrain
You can cry on my shoulder...
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me
Big girls ain't supposed to cry,
If you do I'll understand,
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it's just that I love you
So come on, baby come on
Refrain
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me.
All your troubles to me
Girl you've given him all you had
He, d better stop treating you so bad,
Come on babe, come on, oh yeah
Refrain
You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me, yeah babe, yes you can now
Darling, ooooh, oooooooh yes, yes you can girl...
I'll be there to help,
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby
(You can cry on my shoulder)
Ooooooh yeah babe, yeah babe
(You can cry on my shoulder)
You can cry, you can cry...
You can't win, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
People keep sayin' things are gonna change
But they look us like, you're stayin' the same
You can't win, get over your head
And you only have yourself to blame
You can't win Chile
(You can't win Chile)
You ain't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't win, the world keeps movin'
And you're standin' far behind
People keep sayin', things'll get better
(Just to ease your state of mind)
(So you lean back, and you smoke that smoke)
(And you drink your glass of wine)
So you can't win, Chile, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't win, you can't win no way
If your story stays the same, no, no
(You ain't winnin')
(But it's nice to see you)
(I'm awfully glad you came)
(Better cool it 'cause it ain't about losing')
Then the world has got no shame
You can't win, Chile
You can't break even
You can't get out of the game
You can't win, you can't break even
Ain't the way it's supposed to be, no, no
(You'll be spendin')
(Your little bit of money)
While someone else rides for free, ooh
(Learn your lesson)
(Refuel your mind)
(Before someone blows out your flame)
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, no
You can't win
You can't win, Chile, you can't break even
And you can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game
You can't get out of the game, no, no
(Ugh)

When I need more than love
You are the one that I run to
When just words aren't enough
You know exactly what to do
And every time I need someone
To turn my upside down back up
You're always there
I'm so glad you care
[Chorus]
You're my best friend, my love, my love
You're my best friend, my love
My love you are my best friend
You're my warm when it's cold
You are my sunshine when it rains
And if the rain turns to snow
We'll still be on that friendship train
Cause if our love affair should end (if our love affair should end)
I know I'll never find a friend
As great as you
Girl, I'm glad it's true
[Chorus]
Ooh, you're my best friend
Girl there'll be no other
You're my friend and lover
(you're my best friend)
Don't you know I love ya
You're my friend and lover
Ooh, ooh girl there will always be someone to love ya
Someone who can love ya
(you're my best friend)
Yes you are
Yes you're my friend and lover
Girl there'll be no other
(you're my best friend)
I'll be yours forever
You and me together

When I was a child
I cried on mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You will come to know
The joy and love of one good man
Everything will come in time
If you believe it
Anything you truly want
You can echive it
Picture the love you'll find
With one good man
Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
'cause you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me
Many years have past away since mama told me
I hadn't find a man
To love, to have and hold me
There where many men
But not of them one good man
I began to dout that I would
Find my true love
But then at one noon it happened
I found you, love
You were like a dream come true
You were that one good man
Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
'cause you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me
It's true, I knew from that day on
My lonely days were gone
Those lonely tears I've cried
Since you are by my side
Now and forever more
You'll be with me
And we will love
You are my everything
When I was a child I cried
On mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You'll find a man to love
And now I see that
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me
Written and Composed by Carole King.
When you're down and troubled
And you need some love and care
And nothin', no nothin' is goin' right
Just close your eyes and think of me
And soon I'll be there to brighten up
Yeah, even your darkest night
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin'
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yeah I will
You've got a friend
When the sky above you
Grows dark and full of clouds
And that old north wind
He begins to blow
Here's what you do baby
Keep your head together
And call my name out loud
And soon you'll hear me
Knockin' at your door
Oh yes I will, yes I will
You just call out my name
And you know, wherever I am
I'll come a-runnin'
To see you again
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
Ain't it good to know
That you've got a friend
People can be so cold
They'll hurt you and desert you
And take your soul if you let them
Oh, don't let them
Winter, spring, summer or fall
All you have to do is call
And I'll be there, yes I will
You've got a friend, yes you do
You've got a friend, yes you do
Right till the end, for you
Ain't it good to know
