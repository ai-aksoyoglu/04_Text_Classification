    <h2 align="center">using Web Scraping and a Naive Bayes classifier
</h2>
    
    
__1) The Goal:__ Build a text classification model to predict the artist from a piece of text. 
    
__2) Get the Data:__ Download HTML pages, Get a list of song urls, Extract lyrics from song urls
    
__3) Split the Data:__ As usual.  

__4) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ No need for EDA here.

__5)-9) Feature Engineering (FE), Train Model, Optimize Hyperparameters/Cross-Validation:__ Convert text to numbers by applying the Bag Of Words method; Build and train a Naive Bayes classifier; Balance out the dataset.

__10) Calculate Test Score__ 
    
__11) Deploy and Monitor:__   Write a command-line interface
