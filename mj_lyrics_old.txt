Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Happy, that's you, you made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I, till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)
Where have I been, what lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until, Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was till now
Till now
Happy, yeah, yeah, happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Yeah happy, ooh, happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy, oh yeah happy
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Happy
word out shockin all alone
Word out shockin' all alone
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwin' rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done enough for me
You are disgustin' me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad
Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing if you please
Though you tried to bring me to my knees
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Hell all up in Hollywood
Sayin' that you got it good
Creepin' from a dusty hole
Tales of what somebody told
What do you want from me?
What do you want from me?
Tired of you haunting me, yeah yeah
You're aiming just for me
You are disgustin' me
You got blood lust for me
but too bad, too bad
Look who got slapped in the face
It's dead and stuffy in the pleace
I'm right back where i wanna be
I'm standin' though you're kickin' me
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ is on my team, theme
Reality brings forth realizm
It's the man of steel organizm, twizm
Not from the prizm, take charge like manilla
Nine five shaq represent with the thrilla
Grab my crotch, twist my knee, then i'm through
Mike's bad, I'm bad
Who are you
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why dont you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
Too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you scream and shout it
too bad too bad about it
Why don't you just scream and shout it
